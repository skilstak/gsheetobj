In fact, many of those currently leading local coding clubs and school programs started with Minecraft years ago at SkilStak. Today, kids as young as seven are learning complicated concepts such as the command-line without even realizing it. To them it's just fun.\n\nEvery student controls a private Minecraft server with plugins and full operator access for the duration of the course.  Each can invite friends and family to help them build it and see what they have learned. Students not only develop their creativity but are introduced to networking, programming, and engineering while building out and maintaining their world and server.\n\nPreparation:\n• Gmail account\n• Minecraft® account\n• Type 15+ wpm",

Students who complete the course can proudly call themselves polyglot programmers and have the confidence of knowing they could easily master any language in their future.\n\nUnfortunately, most schools only teach a single language creating strong biases in beginning programmers (or aversion often in the case of Java) who often never learn another leading many to limit their opportunities both professionally and socially with pedantic technical bigotry. We teach to learn and use the right tool for the job.\n\nMost programmers will continue on to become developers adding mastery of paradigms, patterns, and best practices to the their programming skills.",

A developer is an artisan who has demonstrated he or she can not only program in any language (given a bit of time to learn it) but also possesses the creative, organizational, and intuitive aptitude to craft elegant solutions to problems. A developer cares about approach, sustainability, and detail and has learned—above all—to focus on the need above the technology. Just because one can do something does not mean one should. Artisanal developers value simplicity and elegance over complexity. They lose sleep refactoring their code to be the easiest possible to understand by even junior programmers. Developers have committed themselves to the art of programming as well as the practice. Other code practitioners revere their creations as more than just code, but as works of art.",

Campers build out their own servers and worlds (which they can take home on USB sticks) as well as collaborate together on creating something fun. Campers don't even realize they are learning core tech skills in the process. Campers are introduced to online coding sites where they can learn real code playing online anytime—even after they leave camp.\n\nCampers who wish to continue their learning at SkilStak should consider registering for the Principles or, if more ambitious, Essentials.\n\nCampers do not receive their own public Minecraft server, but they can continue with the full course in the Fall where students do get their own servers."

The same engine used to create Fortnite® designed and used by perhaps the best game company to ever exist, EPIC® (which happens to headquartered be in Cary, NC). There really is no reason to learn any other engine. Unreal® has become the gold standard used by universities and others for premier Game and Simulation training.\n\nCampers will start by making a very basic map and coding simple additions one at a time. The focus of this camp is on integrating C++ with the Blueprints system. Those interested in focusing on map and game design should consider the camp later in the Summer that focuses on that (and requires less programming knowledge).\n\nSome programming background is definitely recommended but not strictly required. This camp is also offered as a course but the course has stricter prerequisite requirements since only seven students are accepted."

Every technologist  must understanding of networking.\n\nCampers learn about networks while scanning and configuring them. We'll watch traffic with sniffers designed to watch the very packets travelling over the network in real time. We'll take a field trip or two to local businesses, grab a snack or coffee, and see what we can see. We'll discuss how important network security is -- particularly the maintenance of consumer-grade routers and how a lack of this has allows Russia and others to create a massive bot-net ready to attack others as it has so many already. Campers leave enlightened and excited to configure and secure their own home networks and understand how to host their own servers safely.\n\nWe'll spend a day exploring and discovering the advances in decentralized computing brought about by technologies underlying popular cryptocurrencies and their impact on the future Internet."

Everything in our world uses code in some form -- including the biological world. Understanding basic electonics in addition to programming is a powerful combination. There is nothing more satisfying than writing code that makes something move, even just a little. \n\nCampers have the opportunity to explore several areas of physical computing by working on projects on the Rasperry PI, Arduino, and for the truly daring, our unique MicroChip PIC® learner programming boards that can code tiny consumer chips in Assembly and C. Don't worry, there's just a taste enough of each to understand the differences. For example, how a microcontroller and microcomputer are substantially different.\n\nThen, of course, there are the light sabers. We solder together competition grade, milled aluminum, light sabers after diagramming the simple electronics it contains. Those who sign up for the camp lab block will have ample opportunity to \"test\" them on the lawn out back."

Tools have been built into it for artists, designers, and coders so that they can work in concert with the least amount of frustration. Other engines can't come close. There is a reason Unreal is the preferred engine not by most every triple-A game development teams, the government, NASA, large event-planning and architecture firms, but also most colleges and universities with Game and Simulation offerings.\n\nThis camp is for future game designers who want to create maps, place items, and add basic game mechanics. Drawn from the industry standard text book on the topic campers first create a simple game and then test each others out providing feedback. Campers can take their game home and show it off with pride. Unreal, with thousands of assets, is also completely free providing the best entry into the game development world.\n\nGame and simulation can be a life-long hobby but the skills translate directly into other technologist careers."

They learn about the core canvas element of HTML and how to paint to it as they create a simple game anyone can play immediately on the web (no USB needed).

By combining images with narrative, powerful story games that depend on imagination for immersion can be created and easily shared.\n\nPerhaps you are not an artist but would like to code some \"interactive fiction\" popularized by the first ever computer game, Adventure, and other iterations such as Zork®. Sometimes words are the best vehicle for a game that draws on deeper images impossible to create except for in the heads and imaginations of the players. Text adventures and story games are a literary niche of endless possibilities requiring very little coding ability and with almost no limitation.\n\nIf you are a literature or English teach we would welcome you as well to show you the power and possibilities coding can bring to the literary arts."

Game development tends to attract some of the brightest coders in the world, and with far less pretention. Interactive chat bots are here to stay. We see them in many forms from Amazon Alexis® to Discord chat bots. Creating a solid and module framework for expanding the vocabulary of these bots is core to their development. Ultimately they are all simple text processing applications.\n\nCampers code their bot in Golang, invented at Google and one of Forbe's \"two highest paying languages you have never heard of.\" In the process they learn a bit about networking, hosting, and web application programming interfaces (APIs). Most importantly, each leaves with a bot ready for additional intelligence to be added later, be it snarky responses to trolling to reporting the latest cryptocurrency valuations. One fun option is creating a narrator bot for an entire story game that can be played together by everyone in the chat room."
